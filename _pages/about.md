My name is Fangzhou Ye. I am currently a third-year PhD student in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Central Florida, working under the supervision of Dr. Hao Zheng. 

My current research interests include Computer Architecture, Machine Learning, hardware/software co-design for AI/ML, and efficient AI. Specifically, I am interested in optimizing computation and memory efficiency in modern AI systems, leveraging both algorithmic and architectural innovations to enhance performance. Beyond my academic pursuits, I am passionate about exploring innovative solutions that bridge the gap between theoretical advancements and practical implementations in AI acceleration and high-performance computing.

Prior to my doctoral studies, I earned my Bachelor's degree in Electronic Science and Technology from Zhejiang University in Hangzhou, China.
